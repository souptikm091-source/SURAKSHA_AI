# SURAKSHA_AI
I had a great learning experience participating in Suraksha.AI – Code Smart with Python, Build ML for Safety, a workshop focused on using Python and Machine Learning for real-world safety solutions, especially in the context of women’s safety.
Suraksha.AI – Women Safety ML Project
Suraksha.AI is a beginner-friendly Machine Learning project developed during the Suraksha.AI workshop by Team Eklavya.
The project explores how Python and ML can be used to analyze data and identify potential safety risk levels, with a focus on women’s safety applications.

🔍 Project Objective
To understand and implement a basic ML workflow that:

Processes real-world inspired data
Classifies safety levels (Safe / Unsafe)
Demonstrates how AI can support social safety solutions
🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Google Colab
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Machine Learning (Classification)
📊 Workflow Overview
Import and explore dataset
Data preprocessing and cleaning
Feature selection
Train-test split
Model training using ML classifier
Accuracy evaluation
Testing with sample inputs
🎓 Learning Outcomes
Understanding ML pipeline basics
Hands-on experience with classification models
Practical exposure to AI for social impact
Improved confidence in Python and data handling

🚀 How to Run
Open the notebook in Google Colab
Run all cells in sequence
Modify input values to test different safety predictions


💻 Run Locally (VS Code)
git clone https://github.com/Souvik-Dey-2029/Suraksha-AI_Women-Safety.git
cd Suraksha-AI_Women-Safety

# create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# activate virtual environment
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux / macOS
source venv/bin/activate

# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# open project in VS Code
code .

After opening the project:

1) Add the required CSV dataset to the project root directory
2) Ensure the dataset filename/path matches what is used in the notebook
3) Open Suraksha_WomenSafety_ML.ipynb
4) Select the virtual environment as the kernel
5) Run all cells sequentially

Follow the steps below to run this project locally using **Visual Studio Code**.
